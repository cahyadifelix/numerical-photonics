# numerical-photonics
This repository will contain codes that I develop for learning photonics. It will contain the basic functions, calculations, and simulations. This is also where I will learn how to develop Python packages properly :)

The folder Pollock_calcs contains the calculations from the Integrated Photonics book by Clifford R. Pollock and Michal Lipson.
